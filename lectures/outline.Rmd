## Prospective Outline Empirical Economics

### Lecture 1: Statistics & Probability

1. Basic Probability Theory:
Experiments, Outcomes, Sample Spaces, Events.

2. Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).

3. Random Variables:
Definition: A variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.
Discrete Random Variables vs. Continuous Random Variables.

4. Probability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables:
Probability Mass Function (PMF).
Expected Value ($E[X]$) or Mean of a discrete random variable.
Variance ($Var(X)$) and Standard Deviation of a discrete random variable.
Example with Bernoulli Distribution.

5. Probability Distributions for Continuous Random Variables:
6.1 Probability Density Function (PDF) – area under the curve represents probability.
6.2 Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for both discrete and continuous variables.

6The Normal Distribution:
Properties: Bell-shaped, symmetric, defined by mean and variance
The Standard Normal Distribution (Z-distribution)
Using Z-tables or software to find probabilities.

7. Covariance and Correlation:
Covariance: Measuring the direction of linear relationship.
Correlation Coefficient (ρ or r): Measuring strength and direction of linear relationship (-1 to +1).
Distinction: Correlation does not imply causation.

8. Introduction to Sampling:
Population vs. Sample.
Parameters (population characteristics) vs. Statistics (sample characteristics).
Simple Random Sampling.

9. The Concept of a Sampling Distribution:
The distribution of a sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) if we were to draw many samples.

10. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT):
Statement and profound implications for the sampling distribution of the sample mean.
Importance for inference even when the population is not normal (for large enough sample sizes).

11. Introduction to Estimation:
Point Estimators (e.g., sample mean ̄$\bar{x}$ as an estimator for population mean $\mu$.
Desirable properties of estimators (unbiasedness, efficiency, consistency - conceptual).

12. Introduction to Hypothesis Testing (Conceptual):
Null Hypothesis $H_0$ and Alternative Hypothesis $H_A$
The idea of test statistics and p-values (without formal calculations yet).

### Lecture 2: The Linear Model

1. What is Econometrics? Why study it?
The nature of economic data: Cross-sectional, Time Series, Pooled Cross-sections, Panel Data.
The concept of a model: Population Regression Function (PRF).

2. The Sample Regression Function (SRF).
2.1 Derivation of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators for SLR (minimizing Sum of Squared Residuals - SSR).
2.2 Algebraic properties of OLS statistics (fitted values, residuals).
2.3 Interpreting the intercept $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ coefficients in OLS
2.4 Units of measurement and functional form (level-level).
2.5 Goodness-of-Fit: R-squared and Standard Error of the Regression (SER).
2.6 Understanding Statistical Output

3. Classical Assumptions
3.1 No perfect collinearity.
3.2 Zero conditional mean of errors $E(u|x) = 0$ for unbiasedness
3.3 Unbiasedness of OLS estimators
3.4 Variance of OLS estimators 

4. Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression 
4.1 OLS estimation of the MLR model.
